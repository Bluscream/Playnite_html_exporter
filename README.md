## Templates
I have provided 3 templates myself a GRID based view, a LIST View and a TEXT Only version. In theory you can create your own templates but to describe this i need to provide a lot of documentation on how todo this and i will first see if there is any need for this.

## Hosting the files
The text only version can easily be used to share your games library with friends or to host this on a website. If you use the images version you either must self host the html files using your own webserver (for example using [Wamp](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) on windows) and some dynamic dns provider (for example usin [NO-IP](https://www.noip.com/)). Another option is to upload your files to Onedrive or google drive and use https://drv.tw/ to make a website out of your shared files on those cloud services (this will be slower).
